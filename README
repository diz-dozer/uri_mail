---------------------------------
What to do after the installation
---------------------------------

After installing the plugin, go to the Extensions tab and select the UriMail subsection: the plugin will create a database table to store the messages.
You should see an empty table, because there's no content yet.

----------------------
Tags, i.e.: how to use
----------------------

The most simple tag is <txp:uri_mail />, that creates a simple form with the three main fields.

-------------------------------------
Tag parameters, i.e.:how to customize
-------------------------------------

There are three parameters that let you change the label of the three fields:
  * mail_label, that changes the label of the email field; its default value is "Your email".
  * object_label, that changes the label of the object field; its default value is "Object".
  * message_label, that changes the label of the message textarea; its default value is "Your message".

---------------------
Managing the messages
---------------------

When you visit the UriMail tab in the Extensions section, you can see the messages sent to you; clicking on a line lets you see the complete text, with also a link to delete the messages you don't need any more.
